A bunch of miscellaneous patches for Minecraft. The feature list can be found
[here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randompatches).

RandomPatches only contains features that require Mixins. Tweaks that don't require
Mixins go in [RandomTweaks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randomtweaks).
